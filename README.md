# Smart Parking System

## Introduction

Due to increase in number of cars, finding vacant parking spot in places like hospitals, malls, etc. have become difficult. Also maintain record of each car and details of driver is a tedious task. There are also security concern when a car is parked in public place. To solve these problems, smart parking system is developed. Python-OpenCV is used to build this project.

## Working

When a car enters the parking area, first its number plate is scanned and the text is extracted and stored. After that the face of the driver and other license details
in license is scanned and stored in a excel sheet. This automates the task of maintaining record of each car.

After that, the empty parking slot is detected and shown, so that it becomes easy for the driver to park the car.
